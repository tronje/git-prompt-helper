# git-prompt-helper
A little program that pretty-prints git information
to be used in a shell prompt.

Currently, this is very specific to how I want it to look.
I might make it more generic and customizable in the future.

I mean, it is pretty customizable in that you only have to edit
the source code to make it yours, but you know what I meant.
